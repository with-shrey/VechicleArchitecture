# Deployment strategies

## Local Setup
- docker-compose to run all services in developement phase

## Staging & Production 
- Write CI/CD Pipeline to build docker images for admin and client
- Create either a docker swarm or kubernetes cluster (Better to use ECS or EKS on AWS)
- Deploy the images in the cluster
