# what and why the technologies you recommend should be used? 
---

### Technologies Used
- Node.JS for Backend
- React.JS for FrontEnd
- Redis - for cache storage of location realtime data
- MySQL - Relational Storage for Storing List of All Vechicles
- RestAPIs
- WebSockets

### Why Node.JS
- Similar Language on FrontEnd & Backend
- Node.JS is convinient in building RealTime Aplications

### Why React.JS
- Very Popular (Easier to find developers)
- LightWeight - Since it is a library an not a framework
- Very Flexible
- Large Community & More open source packages

### Why Redis
- Updating Relational data base very frequently can be slow
- Redis has a key expire option where we can specify 10s, so if some vehicle doesnt send updates for 10s we can notify admin

### MySQL
- Keeps Storage of all vechicles registered with company so that the data is not lost

### RestAPIs
- Vechicles will use rest api to send location data to server 
Request Body: 
```
{
  la: "",
  lo: ""
}
```
- Admin will use RestApi to fetch all vehicles

### WebSockets
- Admin will use websockets to receive real-time updates of vechicles
